I had actually taken off this past week off of work just because I needed a mental-health break and also to work on my coding during the down-time. Guess what didn't happen during my time-off? Ding ding ding! Coding! 

This isn't the first time I have had a "Code Block" and most certainly won't be the last. However, I would like to discuss how my coding blocks have come about, lasted for so long and how they could have easily been prevented. 

I have had this happen to me about three times now so far in my coding career and when you get right down to the main root of the problem it always stems down to my stubborness against asking for help. Whenever I get stuck on a certain lab instead of asking for help like a normal person, I suffer through until I either figure it out on my own or eventually break down and ask for help. I am not sure where this problem stems from originally, but it's what I am working on currently to overcome. 

In some instances, working through a lab on your own and suffering through until you figure out can do some good. It can build your perserverance, confidence, and give you the best feeling of accomplishment. Although a more time efficient and all-around easier way to operate would just be to ask for help when needed and not to be afraid to ask questions because let's face it, we all are amateurs here; that's why we came here, to learn.. together.
